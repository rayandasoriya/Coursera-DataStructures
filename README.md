# Coursera-AlgorithmicToolbox


This repository contains my work for the course Data Structures under Data Structure and Algorithms by University of California San Diego & National Research University Higher School of Economics on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-structures/home/welcome). 

All the programs are optimized under the limitations of time and memory constraints. Different folders contain the work done per week and all the test cases are satisfied.
